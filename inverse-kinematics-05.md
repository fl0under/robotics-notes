title: 'Inverse Kinematics for a General Purpose Robot Arm That Moves in 3D'
---

A 6-link industrial robot such as the Puma 560 has eight different arm configurations.

The arm can be in either a left-handed or right-handed configuration, 2 possible configurations. In addition the elbow can be either above or below the shoulder, another 2 possible configurations. Finally the gripper can be at a particular angle about the gripper axis, or the same angle plus 180 degrees â€” for a common two-fingered or parallel jaw gripper it makes no difference. This is another 2 possible configurations. In total there are 2x2x2 possible configurations, a total of 8.
