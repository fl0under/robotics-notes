title: 'Cartesian Interpolated Motion'
---

Determine the pose at each intermediate point

* then use inverse kinematics to find the joint angles.

Results in straight line motion in 3D space.

Still, there is little difference between Cartesian interpolated motion and joint books interpolated motion.

* although Cartesian interpolated motion is more computationally expensive
