The spatial velocity $\nu$, also called twist, is a vector of six parameters that describes the instantaneous velocity in 3D.

$$\mathbf{\nu}=(\nu_x,\nu_y,\nu_z,\omega_x,\omega_y,\omega_z)$$

Three of these elements describe the velocity of a point moving in 3D-space, and the other three describe the angular velocity of a body rotating in 3D-space.
