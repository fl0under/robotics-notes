<h1 class="title">Rotation angle sequences in 3D</h1>
</header>
<h3 id="eulers-rotation-theorem">Euler’s rotation theorem</h3>
<p>(Paraphrased)</p>
<p>Any rotation can be expressed by a sequence of rotations (not more than three), where no two successive rotations are about the same axis.</p>
<h3 id="euler-angles">Euler angles</h3>
<p>These are the set of rotations where there are two rotations about the same axis (but not sequentially).</p>
<p><strong>XYX, XZX, YXY, YZY, ZXZ, ZYZ</strong></p>
<p><strong>ZYZ</strong> is commonly referred to as ‘Euler angles’, but mind it is only one of the six possible.</p>
<p>Euler angles are not unique a representation of orientation in space.</p>
<p>Rotate on new axis.</p>
<p>For the Euler angle approach, the order of the matrix multiplication and transformations are the same as the order they occur.</p>
<h3 id="cardan-angles">Cardan angles</h3>
<p>These are the remaining sets of rotation sequences which satisfy Euler’s rotation theorem. All rotations are about different axes.</p>
<p>They are</p>
<p><strong>XYZ, XZY, YXZ, YZX, ZXY, ZYX</strong></p>
<p><strong>XYZ</strong> and <strong>ZYX</strong> are both commonly referred to as <em>roll pitch yaw</em> angles. Which one is referred to depends on the context. <strong>XYZ</strong> seems to be the default for Robotics M course.</p>
<p>Rotate on original axis.</p>
<p>For fixed angle approach: the order of transformations (including translation) should be all reversed. Say a frame {B} is located as follows: initially coincident with a frame {A}, we perform a rotation about ZA axis, followed a rotation about YA axis, followed by a translation along [XA, YA, ZA].</p>
<p>Then the transformation matrix (4X4) is: Trans[XA, YA, ZA].Rot(YA).Rot(ZA)</p>
