title: 'Base and tool transforms'
---

In reality, we want the end point of the robot to be the end of whatever tool is attached to the robot. Need to apply a tool transform to the end pose of the robot.

Also can apply a *base* transform to reposition or reorient the robot in space, i.e. flip the robot upside down etc.
