title: 'Numerical Inverse Kinematics'

Initial conditions will determine the configuration of the end pose, trial and error may be needed, i.e. can't guarantee a particular configuration.

Can be computationally expensive (iterative algorithm).

Numerical inverse kinematics works well for redundant robots.
