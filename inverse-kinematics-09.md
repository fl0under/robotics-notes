title: 'Reachability and Singularity'
---

## Reachability

Robot may not be able to reach the requested pose

* Numerical algorithm may fail to converge
* Analytic approach may try computing square root of a negative number or the inverse cosine of a number whose magnitude is greater than 1

## Singularity

Related to the Gimbal lock problem.

If particular axes are aligned, can loose a degree of freedom, affecting the robots ability to reach some positions.
