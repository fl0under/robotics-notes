## Euclidean Geometry

+ Most common type of geometry. 
+ From 300 BCE, as in the series of books called the "The Elements".
+ It is the geometry of a plane and 3D space: lines, triangles, circles etc.
+ Based on a few axioms
+ Does not apply to non-planar surfaces such as a sphere, but can be a good
  approximation over small areas


## Cartesian Geometry

+ Added algebra to Euclidean geometry
  - Shapes could be expressed by equations
+ Developed the coordinate system
  - Two axis: 2D coordinate frame
+ Points: a location in the n-dimensional space
  - Use uppercase letters as its name
+ Vectors: an 'arrow' from the origin of the coordinate frame to a point
  - Has components in each of the n-dimensions
  - Use lowercase letters as its name
  - Can be represented as a matrix
    - e.g. $p = [\begin{matrix} a & b \end{matrix}]^T$
  - Or can be represented using unit vectors
    - $p = a \hat{x} + b\hat{y}$
  - Can add and subtract vectors
  - Can multiply a vector by a scalar

### Right-handed Coordinate Frame

The y-axis is 90 degrees in an anti-clockwise direction from the x-axis.
